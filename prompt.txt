Act as a Senior DevOps & Git Expert. I am working on a Windows machine (PowerShell).

**The Situation:**
I have a FastAPI project (`agriloop_backend`). I accidentally committed and pushed `.env` and `venv` folders to GitHub. I have tried to revert, but the repository state is messy.

**The Goal:**
I need a single **PowerShell script** that I can copy and run to fix everything automatically.

**The Script Must Do the Following Steps:**
1.  **Reset Staging:** Unstage all current changes (`git reset`).
2.  **Create/Fix .gitignore:** Overwrite the `.gitignore` file to strictly ignore:
    * `venv/` and `*/venv/`
    * `.env` and `*/.env`
    * `__pycache__/`
3.  **Clear Cache:** Force remove `.env` and `venv` from the Git Index (Cache) so they are no longer tracked, but **keep them on my local disk**.
4.  **Re-Add Files:** Run `git add .` (which should now respect the new .gitignore).
5.  **Commit:** Create a commit message "Fix: Cleaned up repo and removed sensitive files".
6.  **Push:** Force push to origin main to clean the remote history.

**Output:**
Provide ONLY the PowerShell code block. Do not explain the steps, just give me the code to run.
